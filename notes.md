## @johndbritton

* Hacker
* Work at GitHub on Education

## Relevant background
* Organizer of many hackathons and events (Music Hack Day, Game Hack Day)
* I've been a mentor and sponsor for many hackathons

## Disclaimer: Think for yourself
* Most important advice I can give you
* Question everything
* I've been wrong before

## This is not a how-to, nor a talk
* A conversation about a way of thinking
* Add comments and ask questions
* You can get by without this, but it will help you

## Align users and customers
* Sourceforge
  * User: developer
  * Customer: advertiser
* GitHub
  * User: developer
  * Customer: developer

## It's not impossible without alignment
* But your life will be a whole lot easier

## Hard way
* Charge your attendees
* Forego sponsorship
* Fewer stakeholders

## Harder way
* Know all the stakeholders
* Know what they want out of the event
* Optimize for your purpose

## Have a purpose
* What is the purpose of your hackathon
* The only wrong answer is "I don't know"
* Ideas:
  * For profit
  * Raising money
  * Help people learn
  * Advance a field
  * Help people get jobs
  * Have fun
  * Host a competition

## My purpose
* Help you achieve your goals
* Hosting an event is hard work, but it's also very rewarding

## Know your stakeholders
* Who has a vested interest in the event?
* Ideas:
  * Attendees
  * Organizer
  * Venue (School)
  * Sponsors
  * Mentors
  * Recruiters
  * Members of the field
  * Press
  * Vendors
  * The rest of the world

## It's a balancing act
* Balance the interests of your stakeholders

## All about the attendees
* The best events do not sacrifice the attendee experience for any of the other stakeholders

## For different audiences, different things make sense
* Example: Having recruiters at an event for students can be a great thing for everyone

## Attendees - Why do they come?
* They don't all come for the same reasons
* Curate your audience to provide the best experience
* Bigger is not always better
* Ideas
  * Fun / Entertainment
  * Learning
  * Socializing
  * Networking / Job Searching
  * Getting help on a project

## Organizer - Why go thorough the trouble?
* Ideas
  * Fun
  * Paid
  * Experience
  * Credit
  * Networking
  * Passionate about the field

## Venue (School) - Why do they let you in?
* Ideas
  * Publicity / Recognition
  * Money from rental
  * External funding for programming

## Sponsors - Why do they fork over money
(we'll talk more about sponsors in a moment)
* Ideas
  * Branding
  * Recruiting
  * Advertising

## Mentors - Why do they give their time?
* Ideas
  * Warm and fuzzy feelings
  * Pay it forward
  * Paid by a company
  * Enjoyable experience

## Recruiters - Why do they come?
* To hire you!

## Members of the field
## Press
## Vendors
## The rest of the world
